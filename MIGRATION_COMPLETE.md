# Landing Page Migration Complete

The migration of the landing page from the old structure to the new Next.js 15 app directory structure has been successfully completed.

## What Was Done

1. Migrated all components from `/app/oldlanding/components/landing/` to `/app/_home/components/`
2. Converted all CSS to CSS modules with camelCase naming
3. Implemented client components with the `'use client'` directive where needed
4. Updated the main page to use all migrated components
5. Ensured all assets are properly located in the `/public/` directory
6. Created documentation for the migration process
7. Created a cleanup script to safely remove old components

### Verification

Before removing the old code, please verify that the migrated landing page works correctly:

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Verify all components render correctly
3. Test on mobile and desktop viewports
4. Check interactivity of all client components
5. Verify that there are no console errors
6. Confirm proper performance

### Cleanup

Once verification is complete:

1. Run the cleanup script: `./cleanup-oldlanding.sh`
2. Verify that the application still works correctly after cleanup
3. Commit the changes to the repository

### Further Optimization

Consider these optimizations for future work:

1. Further optimize image assets
2. Implement proper lazy loading for below-the-fold content
3. Add comprehensive performance monitoring
4. Set up automated testing for the new components
5. Improve accessibility features
